07-Apr-2002 -- The first point for today was N48 E009. Through the blackwood forest we reached Worndorf. From there we went in northern direction to Buchheim. We parked our car at the edge of the field and could localize the exact position of the confluence point in only a few minutes.

After having taken some photos we continued our journey to N48 E010.
