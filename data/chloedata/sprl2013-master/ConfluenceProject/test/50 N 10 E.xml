07-Oct-2007 -- Having visited N50 E011, we continued our journey westwards, the next target on our way home from a gathering of some of the authors of the Explorer Magazin was N50 E10.

While it was dark, when we visited the point some years ago we had a beaming blue sky and great weather this time. We parked our Jeep near N50 00.068 E10 00.075 and explained the farmer, which was working there, why we would like to enter his land. He kindly agreed and mentioned a nearby confluence monument to us.

Finding the exact location of the point was no problem since it´s located in the middle of a field and the GPS reception was great. We went back to the Jeep and visited the nearby Motocross area. There we weren´t able to find the GeoCache 50 10 due to the many drivers.

Of course we also visited the nearby Confluence monument and then continued our way to our friends in Marktheidenfeld, the last stop on our way home.
