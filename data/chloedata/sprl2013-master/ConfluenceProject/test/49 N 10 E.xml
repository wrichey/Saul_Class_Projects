20-Feb-2008 -- Again a confluence in the forest...And this one was really hard if you don´t know the right way. After a 25 min walk it took me almost half an hour to get through the bushes. The sign you find down at the road is almost 100 m away from the confluence. The map from the nearby town Rosenberg was indeed very helpful to find the way through the woods...
