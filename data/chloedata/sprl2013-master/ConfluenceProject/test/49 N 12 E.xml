23-Feb-2002 -- On our trip through southern Germany, coming from N49 E011 we reached the parking lot between the city of Eilsbrunn and the highway A3 which was already described by the first visitors. There we left our car and went into the forest. After we’ve crossed some quite dense bushes we realize, that we could have reached the confluence point also by a regular way through the forest without scratches from bushes and trees.

About 40 feet from the way the confluence point is located under some trees. Because of the bad GPS coverage in took some time to take the usual photo of the GPS receiver, but finally we succeeded. About 30 ft. from the actual confluence point you can find a wooden sign, left here by Mr. Augdoppler from Austria. Further comments about his visits and his signs can be found in the online publication &quot;Explorer Magazin&quot; (www.explorermagazin.de).

After having taken the necessary pictures of the surrounding area we started our way back to our car. Sure, this time we took the regular way back to the street, where we met some lumberjacks. After about 20 minutes we’ve reached our car and headed off to N49 E013.
