19-Jan-2010 -- During a visiting trip direction Hessen I reached two Confluence Points. The first visit is the CP 50°N-11°E, which was easily accessible.

After leaving the Autobahn A70 at junction 18 (Scheßlitz) you pass Scheßlitz and reach Windischletten after about three kilometers. In better weather conditions you should take the ‘Zapfendorfer Straße’, leading north from the main road. But these days the road was very icy and it was not possible to go upwards by car. So the best parking place was the area at the western end of the village. From there I walked over the snow covered fields about 850 meters to the CP. It is situated short behind the border of a little forest, next to a field. While having a quite good precision of the GPS signal I did the needed pictures. On my way back, by using the Zapfendorfer Straße downwards, I found a quite old advertisement for beverages on a house at the main road.

That was a visit of a secondary Confluence Point, but nevertheless I like it to see the many zeros on the display.
