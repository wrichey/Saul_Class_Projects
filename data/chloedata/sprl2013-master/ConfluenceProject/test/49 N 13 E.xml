10-Jun-2008 -- While everybody watched the European Soccer Championship on TV, I hunted the last Bavarian confluence. Highways and streets were empty, the weather perfect. Leaving the A3 near Deggendorf it took me some 20 minutes to park the car about 100 m away from the confluence.

As the forest (again a confluence in the woods...) was very dark, I had to dance a while to get the Zeros. What a nice quiet place in summer. I searched for a nearby geocache and left the place after taking my photos being happy to have done all Bavarian confluences.
