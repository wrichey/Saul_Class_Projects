25-Mar-2001 -- It was only a short time ago when I learned about the Degree Confluence Project, and I felt instanteously interested. At the time I checked the pending list, this confluence was still marked as unvisited (all the others nearer to my home location had already been visited). So I decided to give it a try and - on the day before the actual visit - jumped into my car just to find out what it looked like. Equipped with no GPS device, but only a palm-size map printed from the Internet, I finally found the probable location not long before sunset.

The next day, I borrowed a GPS navigation aid from a friend and tried again. I was about to postpone the visit because it was getting late and I knew it would take me more than a two hours to drive. But the clock had just been set to daylight saving time, so I decided to make it real.

With help from the knowledge gained the day before, it was easy to find the place again - and I was delighted to see that my previous visit was only about 20 m off the confluence shown by the GPS device. The map had shown it ca. 100 north of a distinctive corner of the forest. In reality, the corner didn't exist in this clear shape, but I had assumed that two intersecting forest paths would mark the corner as the best approximation - and I was right. The confluence was ca. 75 m north of the intersection.

With the help of a high-speed film and the daylight saving time, I took some photos before I left.
