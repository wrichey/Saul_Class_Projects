    <CP>50°N 9°E</CP>
    <TEXT>
29-Nov-2007 -- A few weeks ago, I drove the highway A3 between Frankfurt and Würzburg once again, like hundred times before. This time, I drove a rental car with a navigation system showing also position data. Suddenly I recognized that I was very close to 9°E and big surprise few minutes later also 50°N.

As I bought a GPS device just days before, I decided to visit this location on my way back a few days later.

I knew the &quot;confluence.org&quot; page before, about a year ago, a TV show presented confluence collectors worldwide. So I opened the web page and read the existing stories about 50°N 9°E.

Finally, on my way back on the trip, I stopped close to a forest next to Zellhausen, took the GPS and walked through the forest and found the location which is marked with a sign. My GPS showed a little difference to the marked point and after some &quot;confluence dancing&quot;, I found the position.

As it was bad weather and already becoming dark, I shot photos in 4 directions and left.

This was my first confluence, it was a funny experience and I am on my way to visit 50N 12E then 50N 11E and then 50N 10E...
