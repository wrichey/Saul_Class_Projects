28-Jan-2009 -- When I drove towards this confluence coming from Luxembourg and 50N-06E, I recognized that I must have passed this location several times before not knowing that a confluence is nearby. I knew the roads very well from earlier motorcycle trips along the river Moselle.

Again, as a a day before in France at 50N-04E, I was a little late and the forest was really dark. I stopped the car some 50 m away from the confluence and tried to illuminate the trees a bit with the lights of the car which was not very easy...

I danced between the trees to find the Zeros (thank God, nobody observed me this time because I stumbled several times, must have appeared really ridiculously..). After taking some photos of the dark woods, I finally drove back home, happy to have &quot;done&quot; 4 new confluences in 2 days.
