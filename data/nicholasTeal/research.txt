The information I am gathering is actually being found emperically in an on-going experiment.
I believe this experiment to be novel in its goal - which is to model the brain's distribution of
attention to the auditory system.  I plan on using machine learning techniques to find the relationship
between features of the stimulus (in this case sounds) or other variables presented to the subject and
the subject's reaction time.  As far as I'm aware, this exact study has not been published yet and I will
update as I learn more.
