Project Name: Auditory Attention 
 
Problem: Iâ€™m interested in studying the relationship between auditory cues and the strength of 
the variables on the overall attention given to the auditory system.   
 
Importance: Understanding how different, specific variables elicit response and attention 
through the auditory system may help neuroscientists with base information to help in future 
experiments. 
 
Input space: We will be measuring features of auditory stimulus, including: pitch, duration, 
location, and oscillation. 
 
Output space: We will be measuring response time to stimulus in order to determine attention given to the features of the stimulus

Known info: None 
 
Paradigm: I think I will used unsupervised learning as my paradigm.
