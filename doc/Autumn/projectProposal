Character Recognition in Handwriting
Autumn Summers

The goal of the problem is to teach a computer how to identify specific letters, numbers, and symbols in a scanned image of handwritten letters, numbers, and/or symbols. This problem is important because having a reliable program that translates handwritten documents into word/text files would improve documentation of handwritten and old documents.


My input space is an image with words on it.
My output space is a text document with those words in it.


There are whole databases for this problem. One such database is here: http://www.fki.inf.unibe.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database

Because this problem deals with classifying images as various characters, I will use supervised learning.
